A C++ Console Application

This is a C++ console application video game that I have written by myself, modeled after the classic arcade game, PAC-MAN.

The Pac-Man is controlled by the arrow keys or the "W", "A", "S" and "D" keys on the keyboard.

The pause is activated by pressing the "P" key.

For better transmission of the original idea, please change the font in the console to Lucida Console.
